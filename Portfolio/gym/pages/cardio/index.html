            <p>This Special Health Report will help you find the perfect cardio routine—whether you are just beginning,
                need to freshen up a routine, or are ready to take your cardio workouts to the next level. For beginners
                or people with conditions that limit their mobility, there are three options to start with: a Basic
                Cardio, Beginner's Walking, and a Pool Workout. If you’re looking to add some variety to an existing
                cardio routine, try our Cardio Dance or Kickboxing Workout. If you’ve been doing cardio exercise and
                want to challenge yourself, try our Interval Walking Workout or Step Workout.</p>
