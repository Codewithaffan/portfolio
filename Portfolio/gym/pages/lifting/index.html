                Weightlifting is an athletic discipline which requires lifting of heavy weights in a progressive manner.
                It not only tests the physical prowess of an individual but also his/her rate of force generation, i.e.,
                ballistic actions of lifting the weights in minimum amount of time.

                This sport has its root in ancient Egyptian and Greek societies, and was introduced in the international
                arena for the first time in the 19th century at 1896 Athens games. Its popularity has increased
                many-folds since then and it is played, practised and has its audience all over the world.
