                Yoga is a practice that connects the body, breath, and mind. It uses physical postures, breathing
                exercises, and meditation to improve overall health. Yoga was developed as a spiritual practice
                thousands of years ago. Today, most Westerners who do yoga do it for exercise or to reduce stress.
